- Throughput: > 1.2 GB/s (vs 800 MB/s in v1.x)
- Memory: < 2 KB per socket (vs 4 KB in v1.x)
- CPU: -30% vs v1.x

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for each class
2. Integration tests for workflows
3. Performance benchmarks
4. Real-world game server testing
5. Community alpha/beta testing

### Release Criteria
- [ ] All critical tasks complete
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No known critical bugs
